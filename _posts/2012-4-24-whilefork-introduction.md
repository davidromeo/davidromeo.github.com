I consider myself lucky. 

I have friends, family and co-workers that push me to be a better person and yet still put up with my antics. Today with some pushing and help from my peer [Robert Greiner](http://creatingcode.com) (dude seriously has some good stuff, go read), I have decided to finally take that next step and start a programming blog.

I've been meaning to do this for a while. A place to gather my thoughts and write about writing code. Also a place where I can (hopefully) give back to the greater community as a by-product of my struggles, efforts and aforementioned antics of writing code and being a consultant day to day.

I was originally going to list off the things I will try and accomplish with this blog but honestly where's the fun in that? We should just see where we go from here. So with that out of the way, let's have some fun writing about writing code.
