title: GitHub Pages Are Case Sensitive

{% include JB/setup %}

This may be intuitive for most people but this burned me last night when I was trying to push a post that contained an image in it but I found out through a rather painful process that GitHub Pages' Urls are case SENSITIVE.

This is rather odd to me being a web programmer myself and having never seen something like this. Since I'm mainly a .NET guy myself, I figured I'd do a little digging and see how other web servers handle case sensitivity.
