My name is David Romeo. I'm currently an Associate at <a href="http://www.ParivedaSolutions.com">Pariveda Solutions</a> in the Dallas office. My primary focus right now is on the Microsoft stack, specifically in web where I have my MCPD. Before this I attended Baylor University in Waco, TX where I got my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. And even before that I was some geeky kid (geeks rule!) that was always interested in technology in some shape or form.

<h2>Why another tech blog?</h2>
<br>
Well I hope this isn't just another tech blog in the endless sea of the internet. I'm hoping to carve out my slice in some shape or form. Maybe this will get me more into open source, maybe this will give back to community in some shape or form, or maybe this is just a place for me to dump my thoughts to. For whatever reason and wherever this takes me I hope to at least inspire.

<h2>What's in a name?</h2>
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">Fork bombs</a> are awesome. Seriously. I guess for some reason I find them extremely elegant and yet undeniably hilarious at the same time. When I was in college I had an exam where we were having to fork processes and I inadvertantly wrote a fork bomb and crashed my computer, losing all my work so far and having to scramble in the final minutes to recreate what I had been working on for the better part of 2 hours. In some way I'm writing this blog so that together we might never accidentially write another fork bomb.
